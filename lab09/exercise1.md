#### Four floating point divisions in single precision (i.e. float)

`__m128d _mm_div_pd (__m128d a, __m128d b)`

ps : packed single precision.



#### Sixteen max operations over signed 8-bit integers (i.e. char)

`__m128i _mm_max_epi8 (__m128i a, __m128i b)`

pi: packed signed 8-bit interger



#### Arithmetic shift right of eight signed 16-bit integers (i.e. short)

`__m128i _mm_srli_epi16 (__m128i a, int imm8)`
